The easiest portion to visit is located in the map above. Here, there are two ruins separated by just 100 feet and a rather busy intersection. One of the sites is more accessible as it lies next to a sidewalk, but the other rests in the median of a busy street.

# Brief History

Around the time of Julius Caesar's quaestorship in Spain in the middle of the first century BCE, the Romans erected the ancient walls of Seville and this aqueduct known in Spanish as Caños de Carmona, or the pipes of Carmona. At this time, the city was known as Hispalis and lied within the Roman province of Hisipania. This territory had been dominated by Carthaginians prior to the Roman conquest after the Second Punic War.
